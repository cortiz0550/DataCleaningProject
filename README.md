# Data_Cleaning_Project
Cleaning Nashville Housing Data. I watched an Alex The Analyst video where he did this same project, but paused and tried to do each section on my own
before looking at his solution. Housing data comes from (https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx)

## Cleaning skills
In this project, I cleaned some Nashville housing data for practice, but also so that I could do some analysis on the cleaned dataset. Some skills I 
focused on here were:
- Transformations (Cast and Convert)
- Altering tables and creating new columns
- CTEs (to delete duplicates)
- Windows functions

Once this data is cleaned, I plan to dive into it and see what interesting things I can find from it!
